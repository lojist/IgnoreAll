# IgnoreAll
Ignore all users within a certain ID# range

Run the program by running main.py

You will be prompted to enter a starting ID and ending ID. The program will then ignore all ignorable users between those IDs (The IDs start at 1 and currently end around 32500).
If you hit enter at the starting ID prompt without typing anything, it will default to ignoring all users. You can ignore all users between certain dates by setting the IDs.
For example, to ignore all users who joined after you, set the starting ID to your ID + 1 and the end ID to whatever the current latest ID is. To ignore all users who joined
before you, set the starting ID to 1 and the end ID to your ID.
